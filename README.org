* poetry2nix
Poetry2nix turns [[https://poetry.eustace.io/][Poetry]] projects into Nix derivations without the need to actually write Nix expressions.

It does so by parsing =pyproject.toml= and =poetry.lock= and converting them to Nix derivations on the fly.

** Usage

*** Example =default.nix=
The easiest way to import poetry2nix is as an overlay.
#+begin_src nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {
    overlays = [
      (import ((builtins.fetchTarball { url = https://github.com/adisbladis/poetry2nix/archive/master.tar.gz; }) + "/overlay.nix"))
    ];
  };
in pkgs.poetry2nix.mkPoetryPackage {
  python = python3;
  pyproject = ./pyproject.toml;
  poetryLock = ./poetry.lock;
  src = lib.cleanSource ./.;
}
#+END_SRC
Poetry2nix is also available as a [[https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/49][Nix flake]].
